### About Me

At Purdue, I worked as a Technical PM for the [Purdue Data Mine](https://datamine.purdue.edu) in collaboration with John Deere, where we developed a first of it's kind, end-to-end ML pipeline to identify land candidates for wildlife conservation. Leading a team of 13, my chief challenge in this project was to build technical confidence within the team and deliver a vision and strategy, in conjunction with our experts and stakeholders. 

I also led the Research Subteam for a Space Exploration focused club (SEARCH), while also setting the initial design philosophy for the organization. Here is a sample for one of the  [Keynote intros](https://youtu.be/BBiDQPIS-Bw) I designed using Apple Keynote. As a Graduate Researcher with the [Center for Integrated Systems in Aerospace](https://engineering.purdue.edu/SoSL) at Purdue on a [NASA ULI project](https://www.nasa.gov/aeroresearch/programs/tacp/ui-uli), I was part of a team working on large scale Hardware and Software systems integration to catalyze Urban Air Mobility growth.

Previously, I was also involved with [Purdue Electric Racing](https://www.purdueelectricracing.tech), where I nurtured my love for motorsport, working as an Aerodynamicist for about a year. I currently work as a Data Analyst on the Medical Group Operations Team at [Mid-Atlantic Permanente Medical Group - Kaiser Permanente](https://permanente.org/mid-atlantic-permanente-medical-group-p-c/) in Maryland.
