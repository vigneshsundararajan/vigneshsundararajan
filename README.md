### About Me

During my time at Purdue, I led the Research Subteam for a Space Exploration focused club (SEARCH), while also setting the initial design philosophy for the organization. Take a look at one of the [Keynote intros](https://youtu.be/BBiDQPIS-Bw) I designed using Apple Keynote! I also conducted research with the [Center for Integrated Systems in Aerospace](https://engineering.purdue.edu/SoSL) at Purdue on a [NASA ULI](https://www.nasa.gov/aeroresearch/programs/tacp/ui-uli) project, where my focus was doing systems integration of over 15 research teams, and implementing an autonomous decision framework for handling emergencies in a national Urban Air Mobility infrastructure.

I also worked as a Technical PM for the [Purdue Data Mine](https://www.datamine.purdue.edu) in collaboration with John Deere, where we are developed a first of it‚Äôs kind, end-to-end ML tool to predict ideal land candidates for wildlife conservation. Previously, I was also involved with [Purdue Electric Racing](https://www.purdueelectricracing.tech/), where I nurtured my love for motorsport, working as an Aerodynamicist for about a year.

My GitHub page is a place for all the projects I've worked on in AI, Robotics and more. Be sure to check out my Neovim config!
